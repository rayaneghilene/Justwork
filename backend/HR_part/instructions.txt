You are to output job postings as strict JSON.
Constraints:

No free text outside JSON.

Structure must include:

job_title

seniority

experience_years_min and experience_years_max

location with type and timezone_requirement if relevant

employment_type

department

company object with name, industry, product_type, customer_base, market_focus, stage

team object with size, structure, collaboration, culture

responsibilities (array of tasks)

requirements with two arrays:

hard_skills: each object has category, skill, importance (integer 1–5)

soft_skills: each object has skill, importance (integer 1–5)

compensation object with currency, salary_min, salary_max, equity, insurance, learning_budget, remote, flexible_hours

application_process (array of process steps in snake_case)

hidden_expectations (array of implicit truths about the role)

Hard skills must be normalized: each skill belongs to a meaningful category (e.g., "FastAPI" → "Web Framework / REST API").

Importance ranking:

5 = critical, 4 = strong expectation, 3 = useful, 2 = minor, 1 = optional.

No filler text, no descriptions, no prose — only factual JSON.
